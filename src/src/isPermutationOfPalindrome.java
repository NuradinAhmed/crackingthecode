public class isPermutationOfPalindrome {

    /*Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phase that is the same
    forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

    Qustions: What does it take to be able to write a set of characters the same way forwards and backwards ? we need to have an even number
                of almost all characters, so that half can be on one side and half can be on the other side. At most one character(the middle character)
                can have an odd count.

                for example. we know tactcoapapa is a permutation of a palindrome because it has two Ts, four As, two Cs, two Ps, and one O.
                that O would be the center of all possible palindrome.
